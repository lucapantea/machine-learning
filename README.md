The goal of this project is to develop two machine learning algorithms that:
1. Predict a person's income based on US census data from the late 1980's.
2. Classify hand-written digits from 1 through 10. 

The data consists of around 30.000 records for both the US census and the MNIST Handwritten Digit Dataset. 
For a more in-depth description of the two datasets, please consult the assignment description or the final report.
